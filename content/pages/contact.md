# Say hi! ðŸ‘‹

Anything goes! If you have a question, critique, suggestion or existential doubt, or even if you just want to share something, feel free to just hit me up! I would love to discuss anything, mostly tech related, data and videogames.

I am open to project collaborations, freelance work, speaking and mentoring.

Do you have another opinion on some of my posts? Maybe spotted a typo? Have a suggestion on something I should write about? Just reach out and I will try to reply within a couple of days.

I'm not really on social media (except maybe on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-gonzalez-a05636127/)) so you will probably have more luck dropping me an email at [hello@alexgonzalezc.dev](mailto:hello@alexgonzalezc.dev).
