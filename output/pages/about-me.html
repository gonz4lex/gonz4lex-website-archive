              <h2>The long version</h2>
<p>My path in life has been a long-winded (sorry for the statistics pun) random walk. At 18 I chose to pursue a career in social sciences and business, which is why I studied a BSc Economics at the University of the Balearic Islands in Majorca, Spain. Although I thoroughly enjoyed my studies, over the years I started to feel more and more drawn towards programming and complex mathematical foundations, which paired nicely with my natural attraction towards statistics and data visualization.</p>
<p>Thus, during the last year of my degree, I formally entered the professional market to acquire funding for my next academic steps. I had a few short gigs related to digital marketing and other unqualified labor, but what I enjoyed the most was my time teaching.
I tutored subjects such as Statistics, Microeconomics, Econometrics, Math and English for a small academy before going freelance for a few months. In the end, I found a half-time job as Product Manager in a Destination Management Company and had to give up teaching for lack of time.</p>
<p>After earning my BSc with a 6.8 European GPA, I started a MSc in Big Data Analytics for Economics and Business, which seemed like the perfect road to venture into data science and machine learning, the sexiest jobs of the XXI century. -- add link here --. Fortunately, my academic background a work ethic led me to find an amazing position as a Business Intelligence analyst in a wonderful company that allows room for experimentation and learning.
Currently, I'm finishing my master's degree thesis and so far I have earned a 7.5 GPA.</p>
<p>I consider myself a resourceful, proactive person with keen attention to detail, critic eye and inquiring nature. I am always on the hunt for new knowledge and learning opportunities.</p>
<h2>Work and professional trajectory</h2>
<p>I have experienced a solid career growth in my current company, MTS Globe. I was promoted from my starting Junior position just 6 months after joining and I'm currently leading the data science and machine learning initiatives, establishing a framework for the development of predictive modelling tools and artificial intelligence applications.
Some of my earlier tasks as junior analyst included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporating business community requirements into development of Business Intelligence tools.</li>
<li>Development and full ownership of data visualization projects with SQL Server Analysis and Reporting Services, as well as Microsoft Excel. Overseeing each phase of the projects' lifecycle. Visualization and data storytelling with the appropriate business acumen.</li>
<li>Development of technical documentation to help reduce the learning curve of the usage of analytical tools and support database developers.</li>
<li>Management of the team inbox and support to the Business Community, providing high quality end user support with training, troubleshooting and development of ad-hoc solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a last note, I also collaborate with the Spanish statistics site Econesta.com as writer and editor.</p>
<h2>Academia</h2>
<p>Aside from my bachelor's and master's degrees, I have been involved in academic life since I started attending university.
For instance, I was research assistant for Alegre &amp; Pou (2016)<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> as well as collaborator in projects for innovation and improvement of teaching quality, under Dr. Marta Jacob. The focus of the projects was to review the competences achieved by students during their studies in order to improve the design of undergrad programs.
Moreover, I was selected to participate in the coordination and organization of the XXXIX Symposium of the Spanish Economics Association in December 2014.
During the last year of my undergrad, I interned for the university's Investment Club, a yearly competition sponsored by Mare Nostrum Bank in which I was in charge of the management of participants and supervision of the contest, as well as brokering and consultancy.
I am currently finishing my master's thesis, focusing on artificial intelligence applications with reinforcement learning.</p>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>I consider myself proficient in Microsoft Excel and the full Office suite. I am also self educated in IT programming languages such as SQL Server (including a Microsoft certificate), as well as R, Python, MDX, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>I speak around 4 languages: native Spanish and Catalan, proficient English with C2 level of the European Reference Language Framework, very basic French and self-taught elementary Japanese. はじめまして！！</p>
